# neural_style_transfer
A mini style transfer project 

I did this projet to test new concepts I learned in convolutional neural network.
The ressources I used are Andrew Ng course, A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks.
I followed the tutorial on TensorFlow page https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer. 
The first notebook is me just understanding the code and the second one is more of playing around with new concepts I learned in the research papers.

PS: the project is still unfinished and needs a lot more documentation.
